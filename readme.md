# Ignat's Web Dev Experiments Sandbox and Learning Area

Hi, I'm Ignat. I'm learning web development and I use this repository to study web technologies and experiment with code.

I am an artist filmmaker and photographer with a strong interest in technology. I've dabbled with programming over the years but recently it has consumed every minute of my free time. The world of code fascinates me and I want to understand it as well as possible. It's still very confusing and scary for me, so I'm getting my hands dirty building this repo to help me wrap my mind around it.

I'm making it public, because it's fun to share and it could potentially be helpful for other folks like me.

I started this project in June 2025 and it's still ongoing.
