# Ignat's Web Dev Experiments Sandbox and Learning Area  

Hi, I'm Ignat! Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I dive into the fascinating (and sometimes overwhelming) world of web development. This repository is my sandbox - a place where I experiment, learn, and try to make sense of all the moving parts that make up the web.  

### What is this repo about?
Think of this as my study notebook for web development. Here, I:
- **Experiment with code**: I write small JavaScript and CSS projects to play around with concepts and get comfortable with coding.
- **Systematize knowledge**: I love organizing what I learn, so you'll find notes, explanations, and even some ponderings that help me wrap my head around tricky topics.
- **Focus on fundamentals**: This is mostly about vanilla web technologies—no frameworks (for now). I want to build a solid foundation before diving into the fancy stuff.
- **Learn Git and GitHub**: This repo is also my playground for understanding version control, testing deployments, and figuring out how GitHub works.

### Why is it public?
I made this repository public for two reasons:
1. **GitHub Pages**: I use it to test deployments and see my experiments live.
2. **Sharing is fun**: Maybe someone out there will find inspiration or even a helpful tidbit in my work.

### A bit about me  
I'm an artist, filmmaker, and photographer with a deep curiosity about technology. Over the years, I’ve dabbled in programming and worked with WordPress, even taking on a few clients. While WordPress is great, I started to feel its limitations - I wanted to create more custom, flexible solutions and really understand how things work under the hood. That’s what led me to dive deeper into web development.

The world of code is fascinating, confusing, and sometimes scary - but I’m determined to understand it. This project started in June 2025 and is still ongoing.

I hope to revisit my experiments here to remind myself how things work or to rediscover concepts I’ve explored before.

Feel free to poke around, and if you find something interesting or helpful, that’s awesome!
