<h1>The Non-Linear Journey of Learning Programming and Web Development</h1>

<p>
    Learning programming and web development is anything but a linear process. There are countless concepts, many of which overlap or build on each other, making it nearly impossible to find a single resource that explains everything in a perfectly sequential way. It's completely normal to feel lost at the beginning.

    It's inevitable that you'll encounter topics you don't fully understand right away. You'll find yourself reading documentation, watching tutorials, and skimming blog posts whilst being confused out of your mind. But that's okay - it's part of the process. Over time, as you work on projects, revisit concepts, and connect the dots between different topics, things will start to make sense. You'll have those “aha!” moments where everything begins to settle in.

    This means you can't expect to pick up a single course and fully understand web development by the time you finish it. You will struggle along the way. You'll Google unfamiliar terms, you'll go back and reread or rewatch things, you'll dive into rabbit holes, and ask AI to elaborate. Your brain will often get tired, and you'll probably take plenty of intermittent naps to recharge.

    The good news is that this messy, non-linear process is how real learning happens. Every struggle, every question, and every small breakthrough brings you closer to understanding the big picture. So you've no choice but to embrace the chaos - it's all part of the journey.
